# Songwriting

Apply the 7 C's framework when writing or evaluating songs.

## The 7 C's Checklist

Evaluate every song against these criteria:

| C | Question |
|---|----------|
| **Concept** | Can you summarize the point in one sentence? |
| **Clever** | Is your concept or twist truly fresh? Does it have an "aha" moment? |
| **Clear** | Is every line easily understandable and does it illustrate the concept? |
| **Concise** | Are lines non-wordy with space for breath and each syllable? |
| **Catchy** | Are the lyrics and melody infectious and memorable? |
| **Consistent** | Do all hook lines relay the same message? |
| **Conversational** | Does it feel personal? If you wouldn't say it, don't sing it. |

## Workflow

1. **Draft** — Write freely without self-editing
2. **Evaluate** — Run the draft through all 7 C's
3. **Identify weak points** — Note which C's fail
4. **Revise** — Address each weakness specifically
5. **Re-evaluate** — Confirm all 7 C's pass

## Quick Tests

- **Concept test**: State the song's point in one sentence before writing
- **Conversational test**: Read lyrics aloud as speech—if it sounds unnatural, rewrite
- **Hook test**: Can someone sing the chorus back after one listen?
- **Trim test**: Remove a word from each line—if meaning stays, keep it removed
