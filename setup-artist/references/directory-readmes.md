# Directory README Templates

Each directory in the artist workspace needs a README. Here are the templates.

---

## `songs/README.md`

```markdown
---
name: Songs
description: Song catalog. One folder per song with audio, lyrics, and metadata. The content pipeline reads from here to select clips, generate captions, and create content.
---

# Songs

Each song gets its own folder: `songs/{song-slug}/`

Use lowercase-kebab-case for the slug (e.g. `a-thing-called-love`). Rename audio files to match the folder slug — if the folder is `a-thing-called-love/`, the audio should be `a-thing-called-love.mp3`.

## What to add

- `{song-slug}.mp3` — song audio (required, renamed to match the folder)
- `metadata.json` — song metadata. Important fields: title, slug, ISRC, duration, writers, producers, splits/rights, mood, tempo, key, explicit flag
- `lyrics.md` — human-readable lyrics with section markers (`[Verse 1]`, `[Chorus]`, etc.)

## Auto-generated by pipeline

These files are created by the content-creation pipeline — don't write them by hand:

- `lyrics.json` — word-level timestamped lyrics (from transcription)
- `clips/analysis.json` — best moments for short-form content (from song analysis)
```

---

## `releases/README.md`

```markdown
---
name: Releases
description: Release catalog. One folder per release with RELEASE.md and cover art. Referenced by era.json to indicate the current active release.
---

# Releases

Each release gets its own folder: `releases/{release-slug}/`

Use lowercase-kebab-case for the slug (e.g. `debut-ep`, `first-single`).

## What to add

- `RELEASE.md` — the single source of truth. Covers everything: metadata, narrative, DSP pitches, marketing strategy, press materials, budgets, performance tracking. Managed by the release-management skill.
- Cover art — album/single artwork
- Any other release-specific assets (press photos, etc.)

## Connecting to songs

Songs live in `songs/{slug}/` — reference them by slug in RELEASE.md. Don't duplicate audio files here.
```

---

## `content/README.md`

```markdown
---
name: Content
description: Generated content output — images and videos created by the content pipeline. Subdirectories like videos/shortform/ are created automatically as content is produced.
---

# Content

All generated content lives here — images and videos created by the content pipeline and other tools.

## Structure

content/
  images/          # Generated images (cover art variations, social graphics, etc.)
  videos/          # Generated videos — subdirectories by type
    shortform/     # Short-form content (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)

Subdirectories are created automatically by the pipeline as content is produced. Don't create them ahead of time.

## Not Here

- **Source images** (face guides, visual references) → `context/images/`
- **Song audio** → `songs/`
- **Cover art masters** → `releases/{release-slug}/`
```

---

## `config/README.md`

```markdown
---
name: Config
description: Per-artist configuration for shared tools and apps. Each shared app that operates on this artist stores its settings here under config/{app-name}/. This is NOT for artist identity (that's context/) or artist-owned apps (that's apps/).
---

# Config

Per-artist configuration and state for **shared tools** that operate on this artist.

## Convention

Each shared app gets its own subdirectory named after the app:

config/
  {app-name}/
    config.json        # App settings for this artist
    ...                # Any other files the app needs (state, history, cache)

The app creates its subdirectory and files when first configured for this artist.

## Known Apps

| App | Directory | What it stores |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| Content Creation | `content-creation/` | Pipeline config (models, resolution), step state, rotation history |
| Content Poster | `content-poster/` | Posting schedule, platform IDs, post history |

## Not Here

- **Artist identity** → `context/` (identity, brand, audience, etc.)
- **Artist-owned apps** → `apps/` (website, fan portal, etc.)
- **Content output** → `content/` (videos, images, etc.)
```

---

## `library/README.md`

```markdown
---
name: Library
description: Extended reference material — research, reports, strategy docs. Scoped by era so agents prioritize current-era docs. This is NOT for artist identity (that's context/) or learned knowledge (that's memory/).
---

# Library

Extended context for the artist — notes, research, reports, strategy docs, data, or anything that doesn't fit in `context/` but is useful to reference. Add files as the project grows.

## Format

All library documents use YAML frontmatter with an `era` field so documents can be scoped to a specific campaign or time period and easily archived:

---
name: Document Name
description: What this covers and when to reference it.
era: {release-slug or time period}
---

The `era` field ties the document to a release or campaign. This prevents outdated strategy from bleeding into current work. When a new era begins, old docs stay for reference but agents should prioritize docs matching the current `era.json`.
```

---

## `apps/README.md`

```markdown
---
name: Apps
description: Artist-specific applications — things built just for this artist (e.g. website, fan portal). Most artists start with this directory empty.
---

# Apps

## Examples

| App | What it is |
|-----|-----------|
| `website/` | A personal artist website (Next.js, etc.) |
| `fan-portal/` | A custom fan experience or interactive page |
| `merch-store/` | A custom storefront (if not using Shopify, etc.) |

## Important

Apps here should **pull context from the artist directory** rather than duplicating it. Use the files in `context/`, `songs/`, and `releases/` as the source of truth — don't hardcode artist info inside the app. This keeps everything in sync as the artist evolves.

## When to Create

Only create an app here when the artist needs something custom that doesn't apply to all artists. Most artists will start with this directory empty.
