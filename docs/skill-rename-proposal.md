# Skill Rename Proposal — v2 (after your notes)

> **What changed from v1:** your notes said my abstract names ("overview",
> "insights", "monitor", "placement", "launch") didn't tell you *what you get* or
> *about whom*. v2 follows three rules pulled from your own notes:
>
> 1. **Name the tool / deliverable** (you liked `graphic-designer`,
>    `short-video-generator`, `songwriting-helper`, `release-planner`).
> 2. **Name the subject** (whose songs, whose brand, pack of what).
> 3. **No jargon** (no "placement", "launch", "monitor", "intelligence").
>
> **How to respond now — just talk to me in chat.** Say "apply" if v2 looks good,
> or name any you still don't like. No table-editing needed.

Legend: ★ = your suggested name · ✅ = you already approved in v1 · 🔀 = a
merge/fold decision I need from you.

## Decisions I need (the 🔀 rows)

1. **Fold `artist-workspace` into `create-artist`?** (rec: yes — removes a skill)
2. **lyric-video + visualizer:** keep as two clear skills (rec) **or** merge into one
   `recoup-motion-video` with two modes (lyric / no-text loop)?
3. **demo naming:** `recoup-demo-release` + `recoup-demo-deal` (your reorder, consistent)
   **or** keep `recoup-release-demo` + `recoup-deal-demo`?

## Count

41 skills → **40** if we fold `artist-workspace`. Tell me "apply" (with your calls
on 1–3) and I'll `git mv` everything, update `RESOLVER.md`, `resolver-eval.jsonl`,
all cross-references and the agents, then re-run the gates.
